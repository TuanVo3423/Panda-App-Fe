# PANDA Application

## 1. Scope

The application's features revolve around two main goals:

- **Capture Questions:** “PANDA” integrates smart question recognition technology that allows users to capture questions quickly. Instead of wasting time retyping each word, you just need to take a photo of the question and the system can automatically recognize the content. This is especially useful for questions with many complex formulas and symbols.

- **Community:** “PANDA” also has a community section where users can post articles including issues, problems, etc., to receive help from other users. Users can interact with posts such as liking, sharing, and commenting.
